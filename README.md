# MistFont
A typefont based on JetBrainsMono NerdFont but with the addition of the symbols for allomantic metals in the Cosmere


### Installation
To make this I used a program called fontforge, capable of using the .sfd file creating valid fontfiles for various OS. I uploaded the truefontfile because that's the one I use in case somebody wants to skip any headaches that might come along the way.
